Final project(SQL+Python+SAS): 
Task: Rewrite SAS legacy code into Jupyter Notebook using Python and SQL.
1.	Read and understand the logic in SAS legacy code- “ISO69.BU2PP.PI.LCREV. CNTL(NYEXP10)”.
2.	Upload the “NYEXP10_practical_exercise” Notebook to JubiterHub.
3.	Rewrite the logic in Python and SQL.
4.	Perform reconciliation against legacy code output- “NYEXP10_recon.txt”,” NYEXP10_recon2.txt”
Parameters:
1.	Input table for this program is “IPO_DEAL_DB.SB_MORGAN_PERS_LIAB.PL_PH2MRGA1_2019_MF_OUTPUT”
The rest of parameters you’ll find in SAS legacy code.
NOTES:
1.	No need to copy the code from SAS legacy code, SAS itself and previous systems had limitations which were affecting the code resulting in low efficiency. While rewriting the logic use Python and SQL to optimize the previous code.
2.	Reconciliation(comparison) of the new program output and legacy code output should have 0 differences.  
3.	Try to parameterize all the recurring values. E.g. if you should work on one key state(12) it is better to create “target_state” variable as a parameter that can be define in the beginning.
4.	Notebook with answer to this task is also available- “NYEXP10_Beka_v2.0_with_recon(answer)” but it’s strongly recommended not to open it until you finished the task just for your overall revision.

Good Luck!
